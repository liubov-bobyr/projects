# Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi there! 
This repository is containing portfolio of data data analyst projects completed by me. 

**Note**  
Due to the fact that sometimes GitHub does not open .ipynb files, ignores the TOC links and does not display some objects (such as json, go, etc.), I added links to the nbviewer, where you can also see all projects correctly. 


## The projects are performed on Jupyter Notebook using the following technical skills: 
* Python
* Data Analysis/Wrangling libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Datetime, Math)
* Data Visualization libraries (Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GO, Json) and Tableau
* SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite


| Folder name | Project name | Result | Link to nbviewer | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|[a-b-evaluation](https://github.com/liubov-bobyr/projects/tree/main/a-b-evaluation) | Evaluation of A/B testing results | Evaluated the results of the A/B test, assess the correctness of the test, checked intersection of the test audience with a competing test and coincidence between test and marketing events, other test timing issues. Checked the changes associated with the introduction of an improved recommender system - will users show an improvement of each metric by at least 10% within 14 days from the date of registration. Searched for patterns in the results of research and gave the general inference about the test results and mistakes.  | [link to nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/liubov-bobyr/projects/blob/main/a-b-evaluation/Eng_Evaluation%20of%20A%3AB%20testing%20results.ipynb)
| [bank-users-segmentation](https://github.com/liubov-bobyr/projects/tree/main/bank-users-segmentation) | Banks - Segmentation of users by product consumption | Analyzed and segment clients to the regional bank to reduce churn, described a portrait of a client who is about to leave, tested hypotheses about difference between two segments using statsmodels. Made a general conclusion and recommendations using plotly, Matplotlib and Tableau.  | [link to nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/liubov-bobyr/projects/blob/main/bank-users-segmentation/Eng_Segmentation%20of%20clients%20of%20the%20bank.ipynb)

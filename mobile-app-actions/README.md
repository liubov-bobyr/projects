# Analysis of users actions of a mobile app with food products


**Research task:**

For a start-up that sells food, we need to figure out how their mobile app users act. 

**Research goal:**
1. analyse the sales funnel;
     - how users reach a purchase and how many of them get it to that point;
     - how many 'stuck' in the previous steps and at which steps they get 'stuck' 
2. Evaluate the result of the A/A/B-test. 
     - we will make decisions about changing the font throughout the app based on the result of the A/A/B-test.
     - in total we have 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones. If the two control groups are equal, we can be sure about the accuracy of the testing. If there are significant differences between the values of A and A, this will help to identify the factors that led to the distortion of the result. Comparing control groups also helps to understand how much time and data will be needed for futher tests. 
     - and find out which font is better
